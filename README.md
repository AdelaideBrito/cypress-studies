To run these projects on your computer, please install Cypress in the terminal using the command:

```
npm install cypress --save-dev
```
or 

```
yarn add cypress --dev
```
This will install Cypress locally as a dev dependency for your project.
Make sure that you have already run npm init or have a node_modules folder or package.json file in the root of your project to ensure cypress is installed in the correct directory.
